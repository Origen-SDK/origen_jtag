Overlay bits will now be generated in-line rather than generating sub-routine calls
whenever RGen.mode.simulation? is true.

Added tracking of the IR register value and vectors from repeated calls to the write\_ir
method with the same value will now be inhibited.
Originally it was envisaged that higher level wrappers would take care of this but on
reflection this is probably not viable since there may be multiple protocols using the
same physical JTAG and therefore it is better tracked at the lowest level.

This change means that higher level libraries can pre-fix all of their operations
with a write to the IR with the value they need and the JTAG driver will take care of
keeping the vectors optimal.

This version depends on RGen >= v2.0.1.dev98.

Major API update and internal simplification. Removed all local tracking of IR and DR
registers states, that should be done by higher level wrappers.
See here for full details of the new API: http://rgen.freescale.net/jtag

Removed illegal references to global objects ($soc, $tester, etc.) and added check that
the parent implements the required pins.

Initial version, extracted from C90TFS NVM app, probably doesn't work
